# SCTP FM Project

This repository contains the minimal set of code needed to reproduce all the results reported in the SCTP FM paper (currently under submission).

To run the code, download the latest version of [KORG](https://github.com/maxvonhippel/attackersynthesis), then replace the KORG code files with the ones contained in this project.  Then pip install as you would normally.

There are three attacker models: Off-Path, Evil-Server, and On-Path.  The correct inputs to use for each attacker model are given in the paper.
